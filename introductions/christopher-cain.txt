hi everyone, i'm chris! i'm excited to learn some coding and data science in this course with y'all. my econ interests tend to be more on the micro side, but i like it all. as far as coding and data are concerned, my tastes aren't refined yet! just excited to learn some techniques to eventually do more complex analysis. outside of school my main hobby is music and i love playing guitar.
